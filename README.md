**Project Title:**
Customer Churn Analysis for Bank Customer Data

**Procedure:**
Data Collection: Gather bank customer data including demographics, account information, transaction history, and other relevant details.
Data Cleaning: Process the data to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct inconsistencies.
Data Segmentation: Segment the data based on various attributes such as gender, activity status, credit card status, country, products, age groups, credit scores, and account balance groups.
Churn Rate Calculation: Calculate churn rates for each segment to identify patterns and trends.
Visualization: Create visual representations (charts, graphs, dashboards) to illustrate customer distribution and churn rates across different segments.
Analysis: Analyze the visualized data to draw insights on customer behavior and churn tendencies.
Conclusion and Recommendations: Summarize findings and provide actionable recommendations to reduce churn.

**Methodology:**
Descriptive Analytics: Use statistical methods to describe the basic features of the data and identify patterns.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore data visually to uncover underlying structures, detect outliers, and test hypotheses.
Data Visualization: Utilize tools like pie charts, bar graphs, and histograms to present the data in an easily interpretable format.
Segmentation Analysis: Group customers into segments based on common attributes to identify specific churn trends within each segment.
Churn Rate Analysis: Measure the proportion of customers who leave the bank within a certain period across different segments.


**Project Description:**
This project aims to analyze customer churn within a bank's customer base.
By segmenting customers based on various demographic and account-related attributes, the project seeks to identify factors contributing to churn. 
Insights from the analysis will help the bank develop targeted strategies to improve customer retention and reduce churn rates.

**Questions Asked:**
What is the overall churn rate among the bank's customers?
How does churn rate vary across different demographic segments (e.g., gender, age groups)?
What is the relationship between account activity status and churn rate?
How does credit card ownership affect customer churn?
Are there significant differences in churn rates across different countries?
Which products are associated with higher or lower churn rates?
How do credit scores impact the likelihood of customer churn?
What role does account balance play in customer churn?


**Tools Used:**

Data Visualization/Dashboard Creation::  Power BI
Statistical Analysis: Excel
Data Storage and Management: SQL, Excel


**Conclusion:**
The churn analysis reveals several key factors influencing customer attrition within the bank.
Higher churn rates are observed in specific demographic segments, such as certain age groups and account balance ranges.
Credit card ownership and activity status also significantly impact churn rates. By identifying these trends, the bank can implement targeted retention strategies, such as personalized customer engagement, tailored financial products, and improved customer service for high-risk segments. 
These actions can help reduce churn, enhance customer loyalty, and ultimately improve the bank's profitability.
